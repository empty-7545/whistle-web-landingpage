     At Whistle, we believe that the foundation of a great and enduring company lies in its core values and how deeply our team members internalize them in their everyday lives. After thoughtful introspection, we have articulated our core values, which are meaningful to us and will guide us on our long journey toward realizing our vision.

When faced with a choice, we always lean toward individuals whose actions and beliefs align more closely with our core values. Here are the 15 core values that define who we are and what we stand for at Whistle.</p>
